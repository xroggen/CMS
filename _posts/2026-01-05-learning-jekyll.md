Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that's perfect for blogs and simple websites.

## Why Jekyll?

- **Simple**: No databases, just flat files
- **Fast**: Static sites load incredibly quickly
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize and extend

## Getting Started with Jekyll

The basic structure is straightforward. You need:

1. A `_config.yml` file for configuration
2. Layouts in the `_layouts` folder
3. Posts in the `_posts` folder
4. An `index.html` for your homepage

That's it! Jekyll takes care of the rest.
